## MOTIVATION
This project is a team effort for our thrid semester class **Internet of Things** (IoT) project. It aims to implement **smart streetlighting** in a way that is **not only efficient**, but also provides some **added functionalities** and interaction with the user.

## TECHNOLOGIES AND FRAMEWORKS
### Electronic Devices and Components
*   **Raspberry Pi 3**.
*   **ESP32** / **M5Stack** Modular Rapid Prototyping.
*   Photodiode.
*   Resistors.

### Mobile and Cloud Platforms
*   **Android Things** embedded Operating System.
*   **Firebase**. 

### Software Development 
*   Arduino IDE. 
*   Android Studio.
*   Third-party text editors.

## SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

Refer to the [documentation](docs/Documento_Técnico_Diseño_01.pdf) (spanish) for further details and schematics.

## FUNCTIONALITIES AND FEATURES 
*   [x] Gas (CO2) sensor.
*   [x] Luminosity sensor.
*   [ ] Noise sensor.
*   [ ] PIR sensor.

## DOCUMENTATION
It can be found in the form of a PDF file for each and every Sprint, accordingly. Those of previous Sprints may contain errors (schematics, pins, etc.). Please, refer to the lastest version: [technical documentation](docs/Documento_Técnico_Diseño_01.pdf) (spanish). 

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We would like to express our sincere gratitude to our **professors** for their invaluable support, feedback and encouragement throughout the development of this project, and to **Universitat Politècnica de València** for providing us with both the knowledge and the tools needed to complete it.
